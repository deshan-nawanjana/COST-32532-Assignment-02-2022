# Simple Login and Applicant Registration System

## Setup Database Environment

Edit `database/connection.php` file and enter your server and sql login details.

Also you can provide a database name and table names.

## Database Migration

Start your WAMP / XAMPP / Laragon Server and visit `database/migration.php`

Once you run this script, database with tables will be created.
Also sample data will be added to the database.

## Starting The Application

Visit `login.php` for your PC web browser.

## Authentication Warning

Since there is no authentication requirement in the assignment, I haven't use any security method such as JWT / Cookie check. Therefore, DO NOT use this system for any situation other than education purpose.
